## Diabetes Prediction ML Model
 - Overview
This project predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on their medical details.
It uses a Machine Learning classification model trained on the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset.

### Process
Load and preprocess the dataset.

Split data into training and testing sets.

Scale features using StandardScaler.

Train a classification model (Logistic Regression / Random Forest).

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

Deploy with Flask so users can input values and get predictions.

### Features
User-friendly HTML form for input.

Predicts Diabetes (Yes/No) instantly.

Shows model accuracy and metrics.

Built with Python, Flask, HTML, CSS.

### Dataset
Name: PIMA Indians Diabetes Database

Source: Kaggle

Target Variable: Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

### How to Run
bash
Copy
Edit
 Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git

 Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

 Run the application

### Tech Stack
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)

Flask for deployment

HTML, CSS for frontend

If you want, I can also add model evaluation results (accuracy %, confusion matrix image, sample prediction screenshot) to make it look more professional.
Do you want me to include those in the README?
